# Voik - Voice Task Manager

Voik is a voice-activated task management application that allows users to create and manage tasks using voice commands.

## Features

- Planner Board (columns = lists): select up to 5 lists, drag to reorder columns and tasks, add tasks per column.
- Task lists and overview: rich editor (TipTap), search/table view with filters and bulk actions.
- Realtime chat assistant: text and voice modes (OpenAI Realtime) for tasks and calendar.
- Google Calendar integration: schedule tasks and manage events.

## Using Voik

To use Voik, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Planner Board
- Open the Board tab (columns icon in the navbar).
- Use the dropdown to select up to 5 lists as columns (persisted in `localStorage` under `voik_planner_columns`).
- Drag to reorder columns; drag tasks within or across columns (tasks land where you drop them).
- Add a task per column using the inline Add field.

### Chat Assistant
- Click the floating chat button to open the assistant.
- Type a message or click the mic to start/stop voice. Allow mic permission and set `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`.

### Calendar
- Drag a task from the Task List to the calendar (desktop) to create an event.

## Transcription (Background, Long Recordings)

- After stopping a recording, click "Upload & Transcribe (achtergrond)" to upload audio and process it in the background.
- The audio is uploaded to Firebase Storage and a Cloud Function transcribes it in chunks. Status appears in the list as "Wachtend" or "Bezig" until completion.
- Very long meetings are supported; you can navigate away while it processes.

Deployment notes:
- Backend function lives in `functions/` and requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable/secret.
- The function triggers on uploads to `transcriptions/{uid}/{docId}.webm` and writes results to Firestore at `users/{uid}/transcriptions/{docId}`.
